## Using data from the World Bank and World Happiness Report to explore correlations between happiness and healthcare in the year 2016.

# Questions to Get Started: 

**:smile:What trends appear when we measure Happiness against other conditions?:smile:**

- How is health correlated to happiness? 
- Are there any trends we can draw from the Top 10 happiest countries, and the bottom 10? 
- What about happiness and life expectancy? 
- Is there a relationship happiness and out of pocket health expenses? To government health expenses?

**:dollar:How does a country/region's GDP play a role in Happiness? In Health?:moneybag:**

- Does the GDP of a given country or region effect the average life expectancy?
- Does the GDP effect happiness?

These are questions we asked ourselves  get started. As we dived into the data, we each branced off and picked our own topic to explore. Each of us hypothesized that there would be strong correlations between Happiness and Healthcare. We challenged our assumptions and discovered the following.

**In our explorations, we tackled what trends we could uncover between the Top 10 Happiest Countries and the Bottom 10. **

- When grouping the Top 10's health expenditure out of pocket with their GDP(per capita), we found that the correlation between both factors is only 0.27. Very weak correlation   at the very best.

- Next, we compared the Top 10's Freedom and GDP to find a correlation value of 0.45. Which is weak, but close to moderate.

- We continued to compare various different variables to each other. As we proceed very little to no correlation was found. We changed tactics to see if perphas a change in       scope would reveal trends. Grouping into upper and lower quartiles
